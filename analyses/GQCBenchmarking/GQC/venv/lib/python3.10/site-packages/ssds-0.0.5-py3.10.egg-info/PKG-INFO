# ssds
The s<sup>1</sup> simple data store.

Upload directory trees to S3 or GS cloud buckets as "submissions". Each submission takes a user assigned
identifier and a human readable name. The cloud location of the submission has the key structure
`submissions/{uuid}--{name}/{tree}`.

All uploads are checksummed and verified. Multpart uploads use defined chunk sizes to consistently track compose S3
ETags.

# Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/DataBiosphere/ssds
```

# Usage
Make a new submission

```
ssds staging upload --submission-id my_submission_id --name my_cool_submission_name /local/path/to/my/submission
```

Update an existing submission

```
ssds staging upload --submission-id my_existing_submission_id /local/path/to/my/submission
```

List all staging submissions

```
ssds staging list
```

List contents of a staging submission

```
ssds staging list-submission --submission-id my_submission_id
```

The above commands can target staging deployments other than the default with the `--deployment` argument.

Available deployments can be listed with

```
ssds deployment list-staging
```

and

```
ssds deployment list-release
```

Submissions can be synced between staging deployments with
```
ssds staging sync --submission-id my_existing_submission_id --dst-deployment my_dst_deployment
```

## Configuring Billing Projects for Requester Pays Google Buckets

For working with requester pays Google Storage buckets, the billing project is specified by setting the
environment variable `GOOGLE_PROJECT`, e.g.
```
export GOOGLE_PROJECT="my-gcp-billing-project"
```

# Developing

Run tests with 
```
make test
```
If `mypy` linting fails, you may need to run
```
mypy --install-types
```

Many tests require access to test buckets listed in `ssds/deployment.py`.

These buckets are in the `pangenomics` AWS account.
Be sure to configure your S3 and GS credentials have access.
