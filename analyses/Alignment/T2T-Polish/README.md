# T2T-Polish

This repository contains up-to-date evaluation and polishing workflows to adapt on general genome assembly projects, with most of the ideas developed and described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01440-3).

For exact command lines and workflows used to generate the T2T-CHM13v1.0 and T2T-CHM13v1.1 assemblies, please refer to the [Methods](https://github.com/marbl/CHM13-issues#methods) section in the [CHM13-Issues](https://github.com/marbl/CHM13-issues) repo. Note that some of the tools have been updated since then, and are tracked on this repo.
