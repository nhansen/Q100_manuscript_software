Read alignment for "A complete diploid human genome benchmark for
personalized genomics"

Unless otherwise noted in the supplement of the Q100 manuscript, 
the scripts in the winnowmap and bwa directories of the T2T-Polish
subdirectory were used to align short and long reads for this 
project, respectively. The current version of the T2T-Polish 
software is available at https://github.com/arangrhie/T2T-Polish.
